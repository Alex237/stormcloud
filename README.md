Stormcloud
==========

An awesome weather app.

- Design and Dev by @consindo
- Icons (Climacons) by @AdamWhitcroft
- Weather by Yahoo
- Inspiration from @d0od, @sil and @GeorgeCzabania

Released under the DBAD License (Don't be a dick license).

Packages avaliable exclusively from the Ubuntu Software Center.

Can't afford it?
----------------

It's $2.99. If you live in some place like Cambodia or Vietnam, I can totally understand. If you're currently sitting in Starbucks with your Mac, iPhone and $5 Latte - I don't even...

But seriously. It's pretty simple to get Stormcloud up and running.

- Download this Repo
- Download node-webkit
- Drag and Drop the Repo onto node-webkit or `nw /path/to/stormcloud` in terminal

Remember, I'm an unemployed high school student. It would be great if you could purchase the app :)
